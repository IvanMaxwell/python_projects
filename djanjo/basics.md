Based on the **project directory structure** shown in the image, here's a good beginner-friendly **multi-app Django project idea** that fits perfectly with:

* multiple apps (`app_A`, `app_B`, `app_C`),
* shared static and template folders,
* modular development using `config` for settings.

### 🎓 **Project Idea: “Jeevi Academy” – Online Learning Portal**

A simple **E-learning platform** for students with **Admin, Teacher, and Student** roles. This app will have multiple functionalities split across different Django apps.

### 🗂️ **Apps Breakdown (based on your image)**

* `app_A → users`:

  * Handles user registration, login, roles (Student/Teacher/Admin).
  * User profile page.

* `app_B → courses`:

  * Teachers can create and manage courses.
  * Students can view course lists, enroll, and access course content.

* `app_C → quizzes`:

  * Teachers can create quizzes for each course.
  * Students can take quizzes and view scores.

### 📁 **Other Folders in the Structure**

* `config`:

  * Contains your Django settings, URL routing, and WSGI/ASGI configs.

* `static`:

  * CSS, JavaScript, and image files (site styling, logos, etc.).

* `requirements.txt`:

  * List of all dependencies like:

    ```text
